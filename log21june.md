- Ability to focus is much better after taking 2 short naps. It may not be essential to take long blocks of sleep to function at peak on some days but it's def itely not good to go completely sleepless. Short naps help a lot in boosting cognitive functioning

- Ai assisted coding is not yet at the stage where you can blindly pick any library or framework and expect it to build apps perfectly for you. However its capabilities with syntax of programming langauges is almost perfect. It is now most important to think like a porgrammer (try to read a book by the same name or search for related courses)

- It is much better to start small with ai, just the barebones end-to-end setup and then "inject" the logic incementally to build the applicaiton. Isn't tha what we as coders were doing already? just that it's way faster now

- It is also far more important to brainstorm ideas before coming to the hackathon. Especially if you are a solo builder. At the hackathon you should already by in build-pivot-build mode. You shall not waste hours choosing between and refining ideas as I did

- I learnt that to ideate, you need to relax, open up the "right brain" mode of helping. This can be achieved by either taking a proper rest day before, having prepared adquately. Or take small naps whenever needed
